# About Me

Hi! I'm Ben. I'm a full stack web developer with many passions and interests. I'm not sure exactly what I will post here yet, nor how frequently I will upload new posts. However, I figured that a good place to start would be to post about the projects I am working on in my free time, in the hopes that whoever stumbles across this page will find reading about these projects as interesting as I found them to work on. Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜Š
