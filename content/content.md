# What I'm Working On

I have many hobby projects in various conditions, ranging from those which I actively maintain to those which I have actively abandoned in a state of complete disrepair and will likely never see the light of day... ðŸ˜‹

Here is a selection of those projects that have managed to avoid the latter fate!

## React Document Transition

React Document Transition is a library which integrates the `document.createDocumentTransition` with React look like `useState`. It makes creating complex state transition animations stupidly easy and allows you to animate elements in, out and between different branches of the DOM without maintaining complex state. Note that this can currently only be used in [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/canary/) when the `chrome://flags/#document-transition` flag is enabled.

Learn more at [react-document-transition.info](https://react-document-transition.info/) or check out the [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-document-transition).

## Squoosh Webpack Plugin

The Squoosh Webpack Plugin allows you to integrate Squoosh into your Webpack builds. Squoosh is an open source "image compression web app that reduces image sizes through numerous formats" (Squoosh Github) as well as a javascript library and command line tool.

## Deno Land

I am a Deno enthusiast and regular contributor to the project. My contributions are primarily focused on the [standard library](https://deno.land/std@0.139.0) and [Deno manual](https://deno.land/manual). I was the original co-contributor of the snapshot testing feature, which I have continued to maintain and improve since it was released in Deno v1.21.

Learn more about Deno at [deno.land](https://deno.land/) or to find out more about Deno's snapshot testing capabilities, check out the [Deno manual](https://deno.land/manual/testing/snapshot_testing).

## CatLord - Minecraft Server

The CatLord Minecraft server is a hobby project which I run with my Dad. It is a private server which we originally operated exclusively for friends and family. We now have a community of around 15 players for whom we run three separate servers: a survival world, creative world, and a legacy server for previous worlds we played on. This project has been a fascinating insight into the world of server infrastructure, Java programming, systems administration and many other things which I don't (normally) do as part of my day job.

Learn more at [catlord.co.uk](https://catlord.co.uk/) and if you want to join the server feel free to email me at [ben@heidemann.dev](mailto:ben@heidemann.dev)!
